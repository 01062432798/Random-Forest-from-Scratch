# Random-Forest-from-Scratch

This is the repo for my YouTube playlist ["Coding a Random Forest from Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvmPnGmCaIM&list=PLPOTBrypY74y0DviMOagKRUhDdk0JyM_r). The goal is to code a random forest classifier from scratch using just NumPy and Pandas.

PS: The “html_files”-folder is just included in the repo so that I can embed the notebooks into the respective [blog posts](https://www.sebastian-mantey.com/code-blog/coding-a-random-forest-from-scratch-python-p1-introduction) on my website.
